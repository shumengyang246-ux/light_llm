"""Compute-communication overlap: the C-axis plumbing shared by L2 and L3.

:mod:`light_llm.batch_overlap.overlap` owns the host↔device axis; this module
owns the compute↔communication one. Both policies stand on one primitive — an
all-reduce on a dedicated comm stream, fenced with events:

* **L3** — :class:`CommOverlapPolicy` chunks a row-parallel GEMM's tokens, so
  chunk ``k+1``'s GEMM computes while chunk ``k``'s all-reduce is on the wire.
* **L2 (TBO)** — :func:`deferred_all_reduce` switches every
  :class:`~light_llm.modules.linear.RowParallelLinear` in the context to
  deferred mode: the all-reduce posts async, the caller fences where the data
  is consumed — what lets two micro-batches ping-pong.

Usage:
    with deferred_all_reduce():          # TBO: RowParallelLinear forwards defer
        ...                              # exit fences outstanding events
