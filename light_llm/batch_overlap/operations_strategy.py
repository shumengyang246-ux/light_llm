sglang's ``srt/batch_overlap/operations_strategy.py`` shape: the *layer* hands
over its own bound methods, :class:`OperationsStrategy.init_new_tbo` dispatches
on the layer class and concatenates every layer's stream into one, and the

list plus the lead width. Nothing here imports a kernel or a model class — the
