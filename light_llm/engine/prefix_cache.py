"""Prefix caching: reuse the KV of shared prefixes by sharing physical blocks.

:class:`PrefixCache` is the scheduler's whole view of the KV cache: it hashes a
sequence in fixed-size blocks, looks the hashes up in a
:class:`~light_llm.engine.block_pool.BlockPool`, and hands back the *physical
blocks* a matching prefix already lives in — reuse is a reference on a shared
block, not a copy (the executor's block table is the indirection letting two
sequences read the same rows). Generated tokens join the hash chain, so a
finished request's whole sequence is reusable by the next prompt that starts
with it — that is what makes multi-turn cheap.

Usage:
    cache = PrefixCache(num_blocks=1024)
    hashes = cache.hash_tokens(prompt); match = cache.lookup(hashes, len(prompt))
    cache.allocate(rid, len(prompt), match); cache.free(rid)

    again. A router that disagreed with its replicas would not raise — it
