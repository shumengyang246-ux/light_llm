"""KV cache groups: one layout and one cache-hit policy per attention kind.

A *group* is a set of layers that share a KV cache layout and an attention
kind, so they can share one block table. :class:`KVCacheSpec` and its subclasses
describe a group's layout and, crucially, how far back a cached prefix is
reusable for that kind of attention — full attention reuses a prefix from token
0, a sliding window only needs the tail. :class:`KVCacheCoordinator` runs N
groups over one :class:`~light_llm.engine.block_pool.BlockPool` and reduces
their answers to the single number the scheduler wants.

Usage:
    config = KVCacheConfig.from_model_config(model_config, tp_size)
    coord = KVCacheCoordinator(pool, config.groups)
