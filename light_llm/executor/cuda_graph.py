"""CUDA Graph capture and replay for the decode phase.

:class:`CUDAGraphManager` captures one graph per (batch, seq-bucket) shape via
:class:`CUDAGraphRunner`; ``try_replay`` launches the matching graph when a decode
step fits one, else returns None so eager runs. Lazy mode (O13) captures only a
seed pair at startup and the rest on first use, so cold start stays seconds-scale;
a shape whose on-demand capture OOMs is blacklisted and runs eager.

Under TP a captured region contains collectives, so every rank must choose the
same graph. Startup grids are fingerprinted, and lazy captures reach consensus
before a newly captured shape can replay.

Usage:
    mgr = CUDAGraphManager(model)
    logits = mgr.try_replay(input_ids, position_ids, attn_info)
