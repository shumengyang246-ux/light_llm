"""Scale-tensor layout descriptors: allocate in the consumer's format up front.

A quantised GEMM does not read its scale grid the way the quantiser happens to
write it. Every consumer has its own demand: a Triton block GEMM walks scales
row-major, while a TMA-fed operand (the DeepGEMM backend, cutlass
``fp8_blockwise_scaled_mm``) wants them column-major with the token stride
padded to a vector-load multiple. Deciding that at *consumption* time means a
transpose and a pad on every layer's critical path; deciding it at
*allocation* time costs nothing, because the buffer is empty anyway and
``torch.empty`` of a padded shape is the same call as of an exact one.

Usage:
    s = create_scale_output(x.shape, x.device, 128, COLUMN_MAJOR_TMA)
    q, s = per_token_group_quant(x, 128, output_q=q, output_s=s)
