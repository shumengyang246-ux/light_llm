"""Tile-config resolution shared by the dense GEMM and MoE launchers.

Two jobs, both formerly copy-pasted into every quant kernel file:
:func:`resolve_tiles` is the autotune-store-first, heuristic-fallback pattern,
with an optional ``BLOCK_K`` convergence for formats whose k-tile has to cover
whole quantisation groups; :func:`tile_tier` names the device generation a
heuristic table forks on — ``TileTier.PRE_HOPPER`` instead of re-deriving
``sm_version(device_index) < (9, 0)`` at every branch.

``sm_version`` and ``has_native_fp8`` live here, not in ``quantization.w8a16``:
they are device queries, not a property of one numeric format, and every
sibling file was importing them from a format module it has nothing else to do
with.

Usage:
    cfg = resolve_tiles("w8a16_matmul", m=m, n=n, k=k, dtype_label="int8_block",
                        heuristic=lambda dev: _launch_config(m, dev),
                        device_index=x.device.index)
