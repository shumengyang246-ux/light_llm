"""Optional sequence parallelism: a token-sharded region over the decoder stack.

Megatron's shape on the module tree, not a compiler pass: between embedding and
final norm the residual stream carries only this rank's token shard, and the
boundary collectives live inside the linears that already own the TP
communication — **g-bar**: row-parallel (``o_proj``, ``down_proj``) ends its
partial sum with *reduce-scatter*, returning the shard already reduced;
**g**: column-parallel (``qkv_proj``, ``gate_up_proj``) *all-gathers* the
shard before its GEMM, because attention reads across tokens. Everything
between is per-row (RMSNorm, residual add, SwiGLU) — hand a row-wise kernel a
shard and it computes on the shard — so no sequence-parallel norm operator
exists and both block seams are covered without the region naming either.

It does not save bytes: a ring all-reduce *is* a reduce-scatter plus an
all-gather, so the pair moves what the collective it replaced moved — vLLM's
``SequenceParallelismPass`` ("lays the groundwork for subsequent fusion
passes") and SGLang's ``layernorm_sp`` ("no extra communication volume") say
as much. What the region buys: norms, residual adds and a long-context
prefill's transient activations at ``1/world_size``, plus the shape a later
``fused_matmul_reduce_scatter`` / ``fused_all_gather_matmul`` needs to fuse
the collective into the GEMM. Off by default until a deployment measures it.

Usage:
    SequenceParallelPass().apply(model)        # after the model is built
    with sequence_parallel_region(num_tokens, marked=True) as region:
        ...                                     # marked linears take the boundaries
