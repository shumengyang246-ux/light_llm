"""The DP x TP rank grid: one global rank space both parallel axes agree on.

``init_parallel`` splits the world into contiguous TP groups — one per DP
replica — and builds the TP process group; asking for DP-attention additionally
builds one group per TP lane (the DP axis) and can widen the EP group to the
whole grid. The ``get_*`` accessors then answer rank queries from module state
anywhere in the codebase. The collective
names follow vLLM's ``vllm.distributed.parallel_state`` spelling
(``tensor_model_parallel_all_reduce`` and friends) so both codebases read the
same at the call site.

Usage:
    init_parallel(global_rank, tp_size, dp_size, master_port)
    assert get_tensor_model_parallel_rank() < get_tensor_model_parallel_world_size()

    The coordinates come from :func:`grid_coordinates`, so a caller only has to hand
    out consecutive global ranks. Which groups get built depends on what the DP axis
    *means*:

    * **Replica DP** (the default): each replica is a whole, independent model and
      the replicas share no tensors, so there is nothing to rendezvous about across
      the DP axis and NCCL is never touched — with ``tp_size == 1`` this call does
      not touch ``torch.distributed`` at all.
    * **DP-attention** (``enable_dp_attention``, vLLM's ``data_parallel_size`` with
      ``enable_expert_parallel``): the replicas hold *one* model between them. Each
      DP rank keeps a full copy of the attention weights and its own KV cache, so
      attention stays local and needs no collective; the MoE stage then pools every
      rank's tokens, which means the DP axis needs a group of its own *and* the EP
      group has to span the whole ``dp_size x tp_size`` grid rather than one
      replica's TP group. That is vLLM's topology, where the TP group is
      ``all_ranks.view(-1, tp)`` and the EP group is the DP/TP transpose flattened.

    Note that once any group is built this call *blocks* until all
    ``tp_size * dp_size`` ranks have joined: that is what ``init_process_group`` means.

    Args:
        global_rank: This process's rank in ``[0, tp_size * dp_size)``.
        tp_size: Ranks per replica (weights split across them).
        dp_size: Number of replicas (requests split across them).
        master_port: TCP port for the TP rendezvous (rank 0 listens).
        backend: ``torch.distributed`` backend; ``None`` picks ``nccl`` on a machine
            with GPUs and ``gloo`` without, which is what lets the sharded layers and
            the vocabulary-parallel sampler be verified on CPU.
        enable_expert_parallel: Whether MoE experts split whole-expert across the EP
            group instead of being sliced along their intermediate dimension.
        enable_dp_attention: Whether the DP axis is a shard of one model (see above)
            rather than a set of independent replicas. Ignored when ``dp_size == 1``,
            where the two are the same topology.
